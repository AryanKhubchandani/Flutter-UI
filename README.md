## Aim

Our project aims at providing a platform for users where they can know what their friends are reading and exchange books with them, along with knowing which book is the talk of the town, and we mean it literally. Our project will provide users the service of knowing what is the most read and exchanged books in their desired radius. This is what we mean by knowing what is the talk of the town. In the future, we want our project to be used by people ranging from hardcore bibliophiles searching for a book they want to read in their locality to university students searching for other students for exchanging their course books. Our horizon is not limited as we want to reach each and every one.

* Open Git Bash or terminal and run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/<Your GitHub Username>/Flutter-UI.git
```
**Step 3: Create a branch:**
* Creating your own branch separates your changes with *main* branch. For example, if things go wrong or you are not satisfied with them, then you can delete your branch and the *main* project won't be affected.

Navigate to the folder where the repository is cloned, which will be named *Flutter-UI*.

Now, in the terminal, create a branch in Git using the following command:
```
git checkout -b <hacktober/your-first-name>
```

Use the same name in the branch created in GitHub.

**Step 4: Make necessary changes and commit**
1. Open the project in Android Studio or VS Code(*recommended*) and make sure that you are on **the branch created by you**, not on *main*.
2. Make the changes on the concerned files in order to implement a feature you want to add or resolve an issue.
3. After you are satisfied with your changes, you can add these changes by using the command:
```
git add <file names>
```
4. Commit these changes using the command:
```
git commit -m'<Relevant commit message>'
```

**Step 5: Push changes**

Push your changes using the command:
```
git push origin <hacktober/your-first-name>
```

**Step 6: Make a Pull request**

Go to your forked GitHub repository, you will see a *Compare & pull request* button. Click on it.
